# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Participant Name: Si Min Zhou

## Question 1

Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2

We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3

The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?

```
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table 1: overwwrite (Type 1 SCD)
-customer_id
-customer_address
-customer_city
-customer_state

CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table 2: retain changes (Type 2 SCD)
-customer_id
-customer_address
-customer_city
-customer_state
-version

Privacy implications: Type 2 SCD might raise privacy concerns because storing a customer's old addresses will potentially result in issues if the data is exposed by accident.

## Question 4

Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://imgur.com/a/u0m8fX6)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?

```
1. The AdventureWorks Schema is significantly more detailed and granular compared to my ERD. For instance, it breaks down the sales process into multiple specialized tables like SalesTaxRate, ShoppingCartItem, and CreditCard, allowing for more precise tracking of different sales components. In contrast, my ERD takes a more streamlined approach, consolidating sales data into a single table. To improve my ERD, I could introduce more granularity by separating various aspects of the sales process, such as payment methods or tax details, similar to how AdventureWorks handles them.

2. While the AdventureWorks Schema is detailed, it does not explicitly indicate the type of relationships (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many) between the tables. In my ERD, Iâ€™ve taken care to clearly define the relationships between entities, specifying one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many connections. This level of clarity helps ensure a better understanding of how data interacts across the tables.
