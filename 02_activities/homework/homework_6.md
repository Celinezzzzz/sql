**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Coming from a background in asset management and equity research, my focus has always been on data accuracy and efficiency. After learning more about ethics in data science, I now see the importance of considering privacy, bias, and fairness in my work.

For example, in a recent capstone project that I built, I collected user data without fully thinking through how it could be misused. Going forward, I’ll make sure that user data is protected and handled responsibly, with clear privacy policies in place.

In the Kijiji Industry Project that I recently worked on which aims to foster a stronger Kijiji community, we built features like 'Follow' and 'Account Verification' to create community and trust. However, these types of features could unintentionally exclude or disadvantage certain users if not carefully designed. I now understand the need to regularly check for bias in the data and systems we build.

Moving forward, I’ll apply these ethical insights to my projects to make sure they are secure, fair, and inclusive.
